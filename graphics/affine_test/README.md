# Affine Test

This project involved writing a simple custom affine library. The corresponding
program is a graphics driver which runs a scene based on the implemented math.

To run the program
1) Download the [corresponding Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/connorjbracy/archived_projects_containers/tags)
   ```
   docker pull connorjbracy/archived_projects_containers:affine_test
   ```
1) Run the image
   ```
   docker run connorjbracy/archived_projects_containers:affine_test
   ```
1) Connect to the image using a VNC client
   * This can be done easily using the convenience script
     [here](https://github.com/connorjbracy/archived_projects/tree/adding_some_project_files/docker_template).
     See [project root README](https://github.com/connorjbracy/archived_projects/blob/main/README.md#Usage) for more details.
