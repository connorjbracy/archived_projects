# Microcontroller Car

In this project, we were tasked with writing assembly code to drive an "RC car"
which had been retrofitted with a PIC18FXX2 microcontroller (in my case, a
P18F452 model) to programatically navigate an unknown course without collisions
by reading values from three front-facing and two rear-facing photodiodes and
controlling then engine.

Unlike many other projects in this repository, there obviously is no Docker
container with example in it, however, the final run can be viewed
[here](https://youtu.be/jxzNtLTtSlQ) as I recorded the competition run we had at
the end of the semester.

In the competition, the car got second place (the hard reverse in the run cost
too much time), but a second (unofficial) run resulted in a time faster than the
winning time. C'est la vie and congrats to the winners, it was a fun project
that I remember fondly.
